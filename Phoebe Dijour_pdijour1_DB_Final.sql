 Complex Query Checklist - Inspect each step
	.	Visualize the question. Use the ERD 
	.	Identify the minimal fields and tables needed for query
	.	Identify filters
	.	Determine joining key
			Do counts on both tables before join and after join
	.	Determine what is the level of aggregation for the question. 
			Is this per patient 
			per patient-encounter
			patient-encounter-measurement
	.	Add calculations, groupers on fields

Inspect each step

Inspect the data using Select top 10 of * from the join of these tables
	Inspect counts at each step
Try to make it easy to read
	Use comments
	
Use indentations
	Use capitalization
